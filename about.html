        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> My name is Daniel Maiello and I am currently enrolled as a student at the University of Rhode Island. 
        This is currently my first year here at the university and I am currently undeclared. 
        But, I am looking to graduate with a degree in Computer Science. I am hoping to take more programming classes and even enroll in some cybersecurity and digital forensic classes.
        <br> I am the second youngest of 5 brothers, two of which atteneded the University of Rhode Island as well. 
        I enjoy playing basketball as well as watching other sports such as football and hockey. 
        I am an avid watcher of the Boston Bruins, Boston Celtics, and New England Patriots. I spend the majority of my time either with my family or doing school work.</p>
